# Ruby on Rails Capstone Project.
This project entails redesigning a Twitter social media web app to share opinions about tourism. I referred to a lot of previous knowledge from previous modules, incorporating the skills gotten from HTML/CSS/bootstrap, and ruby and rails to implement a simple MVP app.

The project has a Sign up/Login section with a username as the required login parameter (as required).  The user is to have a photo to depict on his profile/opinions and also a  cover image that declares his profile. These images are in URL form, and if he chooses to be shy about his face, he can use the default image.

Having logged in the user can view other user's posts about crypto on a general 'timeline' and on the pane to the right,  users who have an account. 

Logged in the user see a timeline with only opinions of the ones he follows and his own opinions. On that timeline, he can edit/delete his own opinions and on other user's opinions, he can 'retweet' (the created copied opinion will have a link for the original user who created it).

We also have a section, that displays a cover image above for the users‚Äô post.

There is as well as an explicit button to follow/unfollow on the profile user
